# Python Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in Python. The algorithms are organized into different categories such as mathematical algorithms, game simulations, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

## Algorithms

### 1. Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

**File:** [algorithms/fibonacci.py](algorithms/fibonacci.py)

### 2. Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code to manipulate the data. This section will include examples of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## How to Run

To run any of the algorithms, navigate to the directory containing the Python file and execute it using Python. For example, to run the Fibonacci sequence algorithm:

```sh
cd algorithms
python
